//Question 11
//Describe the difference between var, dynamic, and explicitly typed variables in Dart

void main() {}
//var is a keyword not data type which holds any type ,
//once you assign variable to value it holds the data type of it and can't change any more


//dynamic is a weak data type you can declare variable to any value with any data tupe
//if you assigned another value it will change


//explicitly typed variables in Dart
//int String bool 
// all are fixed , once the variable declared with one of them
// it won't be change

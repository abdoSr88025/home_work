// 3. Declare a var variable and assign a string value to it. Then reassign an integer to the same
// variable. Print the variable after each assignment.

void main() {
  var x = 'city';
  print(x);
  x = 10;
  //x assigned and declared as String type because var is a keyword
  //x will be String and we wont be able to declare or assign another data type to it
  print(x);
